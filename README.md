**# Project 3: Spots**

**## Description**

Spots is a simple social media platform where you can post pictures and write different things about yourself online. This website is available to use for any device whether its a phone, tablet, or even your computer.

**## Tech Stack**

- HTML
  I used html to build the foundation of the website using different things such as semantic tags, classes, meta tags, stylesheets and etc.

- CSS
  I used CSS in order to decorate, organize, and make the website flexible for all users to use. I used my knowledge on things like margins, padding, borders, text styles, fonts, and even media more to make this website look amazing.

- Responsive Design
  I used media queries in order to make this website usable on phones, tablets, and even computers so you can use it on any device.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
